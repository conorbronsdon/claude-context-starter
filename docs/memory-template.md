# Memory template

Drop this into `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/MEMORY.md` to seed your auto-memory index. Claude Code will load it on every conversation in this project.

See `docs/auto-memory.md` for the full spec (what to save, what NOT to save, body structure, the two-step write).

# Auto Memory

## User

<!-- One-line pointers to user_*.md detail files. Examples:
- [Role + expertise](user_role.md) — senior backend, deep Go, new to React side of this repo
-->

## Environment

<!-- One-line pointers to env_*.md detail files (toolchain quirks, platform gotchas). Examples:
- [Windows Git Bash regex](env_git_bash_regex.md) — `grep -P` not supported. Use `sed` in hooks.
-->

## Projects

<!-- One-line pointers to project_*.md detail files (in-flight work, decisions, why). Examples:
- [Auth middleware rewrite](project_auth_rewrite.md) — compliance-driven, not tech debt. Sub-scope decisions favor compliance over ergonomics.
-->

## Feedback

<!-- One-line pointers to feedback_*.md detail files (how the user wants you to work). Examples:
- [No mocked DBs in integration tests](feedback_no_mocked_db.md) — prior mock/prod divergence masked a broken migration.
- [Terse responses, no trailing summaries](feedback_terse_responses.md) — user reads the diff.
-->

## References

<!-- One-line pointers to reference_*.md detail files (external systems by purpose). Examples:
- [Pipeline bug tracker](reference_linear_ingest.md) — Linear project "INGEST"
- [Oncall latency dashboard](reference_grafana_latency.md) — grafana.internal/d/api-latency
-->

## Conventions

- **One detail file per memory.** Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `type`.
- **MEMORY.md is index-only.** One line per entry, under ~150 chars. No frontmatter on this file.
- **Organize by type, then topic.** Not chronologically.
- **Cap at ~100 lines.** When approaching, consolidate or move to `ARCHIVE.md`.

## First-time setup

```bash
PROJECT_KEY=$(pwd | sed 's|[:\\/]|-|g')
MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/$PROJECT_KEY/memory"
mkdir -p "$MEMORY_DIR"
cp docs/memory-template.md "$MEMORY_DIR/MEMORY.md"
# then edit out the docs preamble — keep only the markdown block under the rule
```

For `/dream` curator support, also initialize the memory dir as a local-only git repo. See `scripts/dream/README.md`.
