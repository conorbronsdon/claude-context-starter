# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — Parallel-session hooks + skill-creator
### Added
- `.claude/hooks/worktree-guard.sh` — `PreToolUse` hook that blocks `Edit`/`Write` to a guarded repo's primary checkout when ≥2 Claude sessions are running. Allows worktrees. Emergency override via `.allow-shared-edit` at the repo root.
- `.claude/hooks/branch-hygiene.sh` — `SessionStart` hook that surfaces non-default HEAD on guarded repos (last commit, uncommitted count, ahead/behind vs default). Stays quiet on freshly-created worktrees (clean tree + commit < 2 min old).
- `.claude/hooks/guarded-repos.txt` — config file listing repo basenames the parallel-session guards apply to. Both hooks no-op until at least one repo is listed.
- `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` — meta-skill that generates a new skill from a plain-language description: clarifies inputs/outputs, drafts the SKILL.md + command file + CLAUDE.md additions, runs a pre-ship checklist, asks before committing.
- `commands/skill-creator.md` — `/skill-creator` slash command that loads the skill.
### Changed
- `.claude/hooks/README.md` — adds the parallel-session guards to the file table, adds an "enable" section, adds both new hooks to the `settings.local.json` example.
- `README.md` — command table adds `/skill-creator`; file tree includes `skills/` and notes the parallel-session guards; new "Running multiple Claude sessions" section explains the hooks; "Skills work everywhere" promotes `/skill-creator` over manual scaffolding.
- `CLAUDE.md` template — command table adds `/skill-creator`; "Parallel Sessions" section points at `.claude/hooks/guarded-repos.txt` and the two guard hooks.

## [0.8.0] — Auto-memory + dream curator substrate
### Added
- `docs/auto-memory.md` — spec for Claude Code's auto-memory: four typed entries (`user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`), what to save / NOT save, body structure with **Why:** + **How to apply:** lines, two-step write (detail file + index pointer), 100-line MEMORY.md cap
- `docs/memory-template.md` — seed `MEMORY.md` template with one-line example pointers per type + first-time setup
- `docs/dream-architecture.md` — three-layer design (inputs → curator pass → proposal artifact → human-gated apply), curator catalog (rot v0.1 ships, pattern/contradiction/untapped/audit planned), proposal schema, local-only memory git rationale, risks + mitigations
- `commands/dream.md` — `/dream {curator}` slash command. Default curator: `rot`. Derives memory dir from pwd, gathers inputs (read-only), writes `proposals.json` + `REPORT.md` + `inputs.json` to `memory/.dreams/{ISO}/`, commits to memory git
- `commands/dream-apply.md` — `/dream-apply {ISO}` slash command. Walks proposals with `AskUserQuestion`, supports Accept / Reject / Edit-then-accept / Skip-rest, applies `modify`/`archive`/`add`/`flag` actions, writes `applied.json`, commits to memory git
- `scripts/dream/README.md` — usage, first-time setup (init memory git, no remote), how to add new curators
- `scripts/dream/prompts/rot.md` — rot-detector curator prompt: role, inputs, classification rules, required-evidence rule, output schema (`proposals.json` + `REPORT.md`)
### Changed
- `README.md` — opening paragraph now leads with auto-memory + `/dream` as the second-most-distinctive thing the starter ships; new "Auto-memory" section with the four types and curator overview; command table adds `/dream`, `/dream-apply`, `/recover`; file tree shows `scripts/dream/` and the external memory dir layout
- `CLAUDE.md` template — command table adds `/dream` + `/dream-apply`; new "Memory" section points at `docs/auto-memory.md` + `docs/dream-architecture.md`
